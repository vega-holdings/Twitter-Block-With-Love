# Instructions

This repository uses a single userscript written in JavaScript. To keep the repo easy to maintain, follow these guidelines.

## Coding style
- Two spaces for indentation.
- Prefer single quotes and omit semicolons (see `.eslintrc.js`).

## Checks
- Run `node --check index.user.js` after modifying JavaScript to ensure there are no syntax errors.
- No other programmatic tests are required.

## Commits
- Use short present‑tense messages, e.g. `feat: add option`.

## Pull request message
Include a **Summary** with relevant file citations using `[F:<file_path>†L<start>-L<end>]` and a **Testing** section describing commands run and their output.
